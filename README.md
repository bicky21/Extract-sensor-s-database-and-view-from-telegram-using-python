# Extract-sensor's-database-and-view-from-telegram-using-python
In this program we can extract sensor's data from live database using python3
At first we have to edit boltcredential.h file for editing bolt device ID and api key then run arduino code
After that we have to run sensor.py for activating sensor's and sensor's live data.
After that we can run control.py
You can find boltiothelper folder where we can find boltcredential header file and boltIot helper header file
